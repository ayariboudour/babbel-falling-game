## Development 
 ### Time Distribution : 5 hours
 Because it's the first time I develop such an application it taked a time
 - 1 hour to analyze the requirement and think about the app architecture.
 - 2 hours to set up the app architecture.
 - 1 hour in UI design and animation.
 - 2 hours in developping.

 ### Decisions made because of restricted time

 ### To Improve
 - The UI/UX and the UT.
 - Visualize the results in another View.
 - Limitation like 3 life time otherwise you lose.
